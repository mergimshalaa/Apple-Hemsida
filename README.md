# Apple-Hemsida

This was the first task we were given during the start of the education. Me and my classmate
chose to recreate Apple's website.

We chose to screenshot the images directly from apple's own website, which resulted in very blurry and stretchy images on our website, which may be the biggest reason why it turned out that way.
